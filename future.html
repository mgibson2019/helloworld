        <p>I have a lot of different things I want to do! After finishing the Neumont web certificate, I plan on pursuing a degree
            in sound design and engineering. I also am a president for Chronicle Theatre Company, a non-profit theatre company that 
            specializes in producing shows from undiscovered playwrites. I want to continue to expand our shows to include the shows that 
            have a wonderful message but may not be the most popular. I want to share the love of theatre that I was taught.
        </p>
